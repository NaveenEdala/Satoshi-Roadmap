# Cyber Security

***[Click me first](AS6380756171694101529140490119_content_1.pdf)***

Apart from the prerequisites mentioned in the main readme, Cyber Security as a domain requires a few more fundamental concepts and topics to be covered. An exhaustive introduction can be found in [Cisco Networking Academy's Introduction to Cyber Security](https://www.netacad.com/courses/security/cybersecurity-essentials), and in [SANS Cyber Aces Online Tutorial](https://tutorials.cyberaces.org/tutorials.html).  

Before you go ahead and dive into any of the fields below, play a few CTFs ([WTF is CTF?](https://ctftime.org/ctf-wtf/)) to practice and hone your basic skills. A good start would be the [picoCTF](https://picoctf.com/) followed by [OverTheWire's wargames](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)!  

Also, If you can't seem to afford physical or e-copies of any books mentioned, fret not! You can download them from any shadow archive like [Libgen](https://libgen.is)

## Tool building
The secret to a great cybersecurity engineer is the ability to build software that tailors to their need. Whether the purpose is to root, test or even protect.
